# Project4_Fake_News
Creating a ML model to detect the Fake news.
Fake news is one of the major problem in todays Data world which create lots of problem and difficult to tackle.

Introduction:
Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era.The spread of misinformation on social media platforms is an ever-growing problem. Organizations, politicians, individuals looking for personal gain and even certain news media outlets engage in propagating fake news to sway people's decisions as well as distorting events to fit a bias or prejudice.

The degree of authenticity of the news posted online cannot be definitively measured, since the manual classification of news is tedious and time-consuming and is also subject to bias.

To tackle the growing problem, detection, classification and mitigation tools are a need of the hour.

Dataset Description:

1. Title: News headline
2. Text: News Content
3. Subject: Category of News
4. Date: News post date

Libraries Involved:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. LogisticRegression
6. DecisionTreeClassifier
7. GradientBoostingClassifier
8. RandomForestClassifier
9. TfidfVectorizer

Steps Involved:

1. Load the Fake news and True News Dataset 
2. Data Cleaning 
3. Data Analysis 
4. Modeling 

Conclusion: 

We analyzed the accuracy, the desicion tree provide more accuracy over random forest and Gradient Boosting.
